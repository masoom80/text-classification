# text-classification
this was my AI final project.
In this project i implemented NB for text classification and used sklearn's svm with TfidfVectorizer and CountVectorizer to achive the best f1 score:  
# conclusion
- **1**: Tfidf preforms better than CountVectorizer.
- **2**: Between polynomialssvm preforms better with degree = 1(linear).
- **3**: Best value for C in svm is 1.
- **4**: Linear preforms better than sigmoid in svm.
- **5**: Rbf with scale is slightly better than other ones.
- **6**: The raw data preforms better than hazm lemmatization.
- **7**: svm preforms slightly better than naive bayes.
